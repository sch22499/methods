Instructions:

1. Run this file through a IDE that's compatible with java. 
2. when prompted, submit any number (we're IDEALLY going to want one that's greater than 15 so we can test multiples of 5 and 3)
3. if the code works you need to see that EVERY number divisible by 5 says "buzz" and every number divisible by 3 prints "fizz" if its both it should print "fizzbuzz"

4. this code should work with any integer.
